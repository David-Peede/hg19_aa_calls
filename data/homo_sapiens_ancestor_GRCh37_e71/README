This directory contains the ancestral sequences for Homo sapiens (GRCh37).

The data have been extracted from the following alignment set:
# Database: ensembl_compara_71@ens-staging2:3306
# MethodLinkSpeciesSet: 6 primates EPO (548)

In the EPO (Enredo-Pecan-Ortheus) pipeline, Ortheus infers ancestral states
from the Pecan alignments. The confidence in the ancestral call is determined
by comparing the call to the ancestor of the ancestral sequence as well as
the 'sister' sequence of the query species. For instance, using a human-chimp-
macaque alignment to get the ancestral state of human, the human-chimp ancestor
sequence is compared to the chimp and to the human-chimp-macaque ancestor. A
high-confidence call is made whn all three sequences agree. If the ancestral
sequence agrees with one of the other two sequences only, we tag the call as
a low-confidence call. If there is more disagreement, the call is not made.

The convention for the sequence is:
ACTG : high-confidence call, ancestral state supproted by the other two sequences
actg : low-confindence call, ancestral state supported by one sequence only
N    : failure, the ancestral state is not supported by any other sequence
-    : the extant species contains an insertion at this postion
.    : no coverage in the alignment

You should find a summary.txt file, which contains statistics about the quality
of the calls.
